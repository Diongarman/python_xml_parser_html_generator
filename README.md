# python_xml_parser_html_generator

This mini project parses an XML file "breakfast_menu" and generates a html table file that presents filtered results using a 
simple Python script I wrote. The filteration rule is: display foods over 700 calories and highlight the entire row for items 
priced over $8.00. Generating html was a simpler alternative to using a templating engine, in a more complex scenario with changing data 
templating would be prefered, but for this simple reporting task generating was the favourable (lazy) solution.
